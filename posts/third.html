        <p>Three posts in and I'm starting to find a rhythm. There's something satisfying about the simplicity of this approach.</p>
        
        <p>Each post is self-contained, yet they flow together when read in sequence. The navigation between posts creates a book-like experience without the complexity.</p>
        
        <p>I think this minimal approach might be onto something. Sometimes the best tools are the ones that get out of your way.</p>
