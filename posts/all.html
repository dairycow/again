        <p>Welcome to my minimalist blog! This is my first post using just HTML and CSS.</p>
        
        <p>I'm keeping things simple - no JavaScript, no frameworks, just clean HTML and CSS served directly from GitHub Pages.</p>
        
        <p>Future posts will be available at <code>again.au/posts/post-name</code>.</p>

        <p>The second post is always harder than the first. The initial excitement has worn off, and now it's about building consistent habits.</p>
        
        <p>I'm finding that keeping things simple really works. No complex build systems, no dependencies to manage - just write and publish.</p>
        
        <p>The beauty of constraints is that they force creativity within boundaries. Sometimes less really is more.</p>

        <p>Three posts in and I'm starting to find a rhythm. There's something satisfying about the simplicity of this approach.</p>
        
        <p>Each post is self-contained, yet they flow together when read in sequence. The navigation between posts creates a book-like experience without the complexity.</p>
        
        <p>I think this minimal approach might be onto something. Sometimes the best tools are the ones that get out of your way.</p>
